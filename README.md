# CS 655 Programming Assignment 1
## Anne Turmel and Noah Picarelli-Kombert

This is the Github repository for Programming Assignment 1. It includes a simple Java program that codes a client and a server program that can send messages between each other. 

There are two parts:
* Echo: Text entered in the client's console is sent to the server and printed on the server's console. 
* Measure: Network statistics of the connection are measured, such as throughput and round-trip time, using client/server network information.
